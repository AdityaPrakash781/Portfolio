You are designing a personal portfolio website for an AI engineer who treats engineering as an art form.

This website must feel intentional, minimal, and emotionally atmospheric — not like a generic portfolio template.

====================
IDENTITY
====================

Name: Aditya Prakash

Role tagline:
AI Engineer building agentic systems and intelligent automation infrastructure

====================
PERSONALITY TO CAPTURE
====================

- artistic systems engineer
- startup builder energy
- analytical + philosophical
- rebellious but disciplined
- dark aesthetic with clean white minimalism
- thoughtful and creative
- architecture-focused mindset
- playful curiosity beneath serious engineering

The site should feel like:

an experimental AI research studio
not a resume website
not a startup landing page
not a flashy designer template

Think:
quiet confidence + sublime darkness

====================
TECH STACK
====================

Use React + Vite.
Modern CSS.
No heavy animation libraries.
Smooth transitions only.
Performance-first.

====================
GLASS UI STYLE RULES
====================

Use subtle glassmorphism elements:

• Frosted glass cards
• Translucent navigation bar
• Soft blur backgrounds
• Layered depth panels

Glass effect must be restrained and architectural.
No neon glow.
No cyberpunk colors.
No flashy gradients.

Glass should feel like:

museum glass
laboratory glass
precision surfaces

Use backdrop-filter blur and soft transparency.
Keep readability high.

====================
COLOR + AESTHETIC
====================

Primary theme: deep black / charcoal
Secondary: clean white
Accent: soft gray / silver

High contrast
Lots of whitespace
Minimal typography

Background evokes:

cosmic darkness
fog
depth
quiet space

The design should feel like:

AI lab meets art gallery

====================
SITE STRUCTURE
====================

Pages:

Home
Projects
Philosophy
Contact

Sticky minimal navigation bar with glass effect.

====================
HOME PAGE CONTENT
====================

Hero:

Aditya Prakash

Subtitle:

Engineering intelligent systems as architecture

Statement:

If you build something, it must be intuitive and beautiful.
Aesthetic clarity reflects architectural clarity.

Secondary paragraph:

Focused on agentic AI systems, automation infrastructure,
human-AI interaction, and intelligence imitation
through disciplined engineering.

Buttons:

View Work
Live Demo
GitHub

Layout centered.
Breathing space.
Minimal distractions.

====================
PROJECTS PAGE
====================

Feature:

VytalCare — Agentic RAG Health System

Make this a technical case study.

Sections:

Problem
Architecture
System Philosophy
Engineering Decisions
Lessons Learned

Tone:

Technical but poetic.
Confident but calm.
Explain reasoning, not just tools.

Include live demo link prominently.

Glass project panels with subtle blur.

====================
PHILOSPHY PAGE
====================

Title:

On Engineering

Content style:

Manifesto tone.
Short reflective paragraphs.

Themes:

curiosity
discipline
experimentation
architecture
intelligence
automation
human-AI interaction

This page should feel like a quiet manifesto,
not a blog.

====================
CONTACT PAGE
====================

Minimal layout:

Email
GitHub
LinkedIn

Glass card centered.
Large whitespace.
Quiet ending.

====================
DESIGN RULES
====================

No flashy animations
No template look
No cartoon icons
No corporate UI

Use:

subtle hover states
clean transitions
precise spacing
balanced typography
glass depth layering

The site should feel deliberate and engineered.

====================
DELIVERABLE
====================

Generate a working React project with:

/components
/pages
/styles

Real code only.
Production-ready structure.
Comment clearly.

The result should feel like:

a personal AI research studio
with artistic engineering identity
